    "# TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is TF-IDF?\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF** stands for **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency**. It is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection (or corpus) of documents. It is widely used in text analysis, information retrieval, and natural language processing (NLP) to convert text data into numerical vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF works by balancing:\n",
    "1. **Term Frequency (TF):** How often a word appears in a document.\n",
    "2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):** How unique or rare the word is across all documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Components of TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Term Frequency (TF)\n",
    "\n",
    "This measures how frequently a term (word) appears in a specific document.\n",
    "\n",
    "tf(t,d) = count of t in d / number of words in d\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "For the sentence **\"I love data science and I love learning\"**, the term frequency of the word **\"love\"** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "TF(\\text{\"love\"}) = \\frac{2}{8} = 0.25\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "This measures how important a term is by reducing the weight of commonly used words (e.g., \"the\", \"is\", \"and\").\n",
    "\n",
    "idf(t) = N/ df(t) = N/N(t)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A high IDF value means the term is rare across documents.\n",
    "- A low IDF value means the term is common.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "If the term **\"learning\"** appears in only 1 out of 10 documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "IDF(\\text{\"learning\"}) = \\log\\left(\\frac{10}{1}\\right) + 1 = \\log(10) + 1 \\approx 2.30\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **TF-IDF Score**\n",
    "The final TF-IDF score is the product of TF and IDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "tf-idf(t, d) = tf(t, d) * idf(t)\n",
    "\n",
    "This score determines the importance of a term within a document and across the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use TF-IDF?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Extraction**: Converts text data into numerical values for machine learning models.\n",
    "2. **Stopword Filtering**: Words with low TF-IDF scores (e.g., \"the\", \"is\") are typically not significant.\n",
    "3. **Relevance Ranking**: Helps prioritize terms that are unique and meaningful to the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple and Effective**: Easy to implement and interpret.\n",
    "2. **Weights Rare Words**: Gives higher importance to unique terms in a document.\n",
    "3. **Reduces Noise**: Common words (like stopwords) are de-emphasized due to low IDF values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ignores Semantic Meaning**: It treats words as independent entities and doesn’t consider their meaning or context.\n",
    "2. **Sparse Representations**: Produces high-dimensional, sparse matrices for large corpora.\n",
    "3. **No Synonym Handling**: It doesn’t recognize synonyms or similar words (e.g., \"car\" and \"vehicle\").\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Basic TF-IDF Calculation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample Corpus\n",
    "corpus = [\n",
    "    \"I love data science\",\n",
    "    \"Data science is amazing\",\n",
    "    \"I enjoy learning data science\"\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize TF-IDF Vectorizer\n",
    "vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit and Transform the Corpus\n",
    "X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)\n",
